# Teams Directory

Sample Gen9 Doubles OU teams used for data collection and opponent variety.

- `gen9dou_fixed.txt` — our fixed baseline team (project default)
- `gen9dou_sun.txt` — Sun with Torkoal + Lilligant-H
- `gen9dou_rain.txt` — Rain with Pelipper + Barraskewda + Archaludon
- `gen9dou_sand.txt` — Sand with Tyranitar + Excadrill
- `gen9dou_trickroom.txt` — TR with Indeedee-F + Hatterene + Torkoal + Ursaluna
- `gen9dou_ho.txt` — Tailwind hyper offense

These are reasonable, simplified sets intended for training diversity rather than
ladder-optimized perfection. Adjust freely during experiments.
